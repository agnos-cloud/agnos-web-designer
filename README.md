# agnos-web-designer

Agnos provides you with a drag-and-drop interface to help you create system designs. You can also bring your system designs to life by provisioning them on any of the popular cloud providers, right from within the app.

The Agnos UI is built using micro frontends that exist in their own repositories. The tool of chice that makes this possible is [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org).

This repository is for the micro frontend for the drag-and-drop designer for Agnos. This designer allows you to design your system by adding, arranging and connecting various components.

See [here](https://github.com/agnos-cloud/agnos-web-hub#readme) for how to run this (and other Agnos micro frontends) locally.
